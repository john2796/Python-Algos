/* 
 Given a string s and a character c, return an array of integers
 representating the shortest distance from the character C in the 
 string.

 Example 1:

 I: S = "loveleetode", C="e"
 
 O:  O: [3,2,1,0, 1,0 ,0,1 ,2,2,1,0]



Note: 
1. S string length is in [1, 10000].
2. C is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string S.
3. All letters in S and C are lowercase.

const shortestToChar = (S, C) => {
  console.log(S, C);
};

console.log(shortestToChar("loveleetode", "e"));
